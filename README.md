# McDonald-s_Sales_Dashboard
Created an interactive and dynamic dashboard which provides actionable insights and allows for easy data exploration in Excel using the McDonald's sales dataset to analyse various aspects of sales performance, item popularity, customer preferences, and time-based trends. 

Before performing analysis, I checked for duplicates and in case of null values, utilised forward/backward fill.
